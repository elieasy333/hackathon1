				<key>Definition</key>
				<string>A structure that [iterates](glossary://iteration) over a [collection](glossary://collection) of data (such as an array) to create views for each element in the collection. 

The `ForEach` structure requires that each element provide an `id`, either explicitly in the `ForEach` [initializer](glossary://initialization), or by conforming to the `Identifiable` protocol. This allows SwiftUI to identify and update each view generated from the `ForEach` independently of each other.

				<key>Definition</key>
				<string>The principle of separating your app into independent pieces, each of which contains everything that part needs to carry out a single piece of functionality for your app, such as showing a single part of your interface or storing your app data.

Modularity is an important principle of creating apps because it allows you to better understand and work with individual pieces of functionality. This allows you to easier detect where something has gone wrong when your app has a bug.</string>

				<key>Definition</key>
				<string>A method for autocompleting code that uses a fuzzy string search to find matching variables, constants, types, and other symbols. A fuzzy string search isn&apos;t exact, but finds relevant matches based upon the characters you type. 

For example, if you’re searching for a [view modifier](glossary://modifier) that has something to do with &quot;scale,&quot; you could simply start typing `.scale`, which would return you autocomplete options that start with `.scale`, such as `.scaledToFill` and `.scaleEffect`, but also more &apos;fuzzy&apos; matches like `.imageScale`, and `.grayscale`.

		<key>delegate</key>
		<dict>
			<key>_LOCALIZABLE_</key>
			<dict>
				<key>Definition</key>
				<string>A special object provided to another object to notify you when significant events occur. The delegate object usually conforms to a [protocol](glossary://protocol), with functions that can be called to communicate back to your code.

Delegation is a common pattern used to communicate between objects, especially in [asynchronous](glossary://asynchronous%20process) processes.</string>

Callbacks are one tool commonly used to handle [asynchronous](glossary://asynchronous%20process) processes.</string>

		<key>data model</key>
		<dict>
			<key>_LOCALIZABLE_</key>
			<dict>
				<key>Definition</key>

		<key>ternary conditional operator</key>
		<dict>
			<key>_LOCALIZABLE_</key>
			<dict>
				<key>Definition</key>
				<string>A special shorthand way to write a conditional statement. The [operator](glossary://operator) has three parts, which takes the form `condition ? trueValue : falseValue`. It’s like an [`if` statement](glossary://if%20statement), returning `trueValue` if the `condition` is `true` and `falseValue` if `false`. 

In the code below, if `isOn` is `true` the rectangle will be green. If `isOn` is `false`, the rectangle will be red.

```
Rectangle()
     .foregroundColor(isOn ? .green : .red)
```

The code above can be read as: if the value `isOn` is `true`, return the value `.green`, otherwise, return the value `.red`.

				<string>A learning method in which you explain a concept in great detail to an inanimate object, such as a rubber ducky. To perform this technique, acquire an inanimate object and begin explaining the concept out loud, making sure to include all information necessary for the ducky to understand. During your explanation, if you realize that you are missing information, make a note to research it afterward. You can include your new findings in subsequent explanations to the rubber ducky.</string>

				<key>Definition</key>
				<string>The concept that an app’s [data model](glossary://data%20model) should be defined separately from the [user interface](glossary://user%20interface) used to display and interact with that data. Data separation allows you to modify the data model and UI independently of each other, makes it easier to understand how your app works, and improves the testability of your app.</string>

		<key>local scope</key>
		<dict>
			<key>_LOCALIZABLE_</key>
			<dict>
				<key>Definition</key>
				<string>A local scope is formed at each new level of code organization below the [global scope](glossary://global%20scope). For example, a new [type](glossary://type) forms a new local scope, and functions and code blocks within that type form their own level of [scope](glossary://scope). Based on where a symbol is declared, it&apos;s only accessible from code that is at the same or a lower level of scope.

For example, if a variable is defined inside a type, that variable is accessible in all functions and code blocks within the type. However, a constant defined inside a method is only accessible inside the method definition.</string>
